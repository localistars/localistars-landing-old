By using the website or the web app, you agree to the following data processing:</p>
<h3>1 OUR CORE BELIEFS REGARDING USER PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION</h3>
<ul>
<li>User privacy and data protection are human rights</li>
<li>We have a duty of care to the people within our data</li>
<li>Data is a liability, it should only be collected and processed when absolutely necessary</li>
<li>We loathe spam as much as you do!</li>
<li>We will never sell, rent or otherwise distribute or make public your personal information</li>
</ul>
<h3>2 RELEVANT LEGISLATION</h3>
<p>Along with our business and internal computer systems, this website is designed to comply with the following national and international legislation with regards to data protection and user privacy:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/contents">UK Data Protection Act 1988 (DPA)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.119.01.0001.01.ENG&amp;toc=OJ:L:2016:119:TOC">EU General Data Protection Regulation 2018 (GDPR)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A03712">Australian Privacy Act 1988 (APA)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19920153/index.html">Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=3.&amp;part=4.&amp;lawCode=CIV&amp;title=1.81.5">California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>localistars’s compliance with the above legislation, all of which are stringent in nature, means that localistars is likely compliant with the data protection and user privacy legislation set out by many other countries and territories as well. If you are unsure about whether this site is compliant with your own country of residences specific data protection and user privacy legislation you should contact our data protection officer (details of whom can be found in section 9) for clarification.</p>
<h3>3 PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT localistars COLLECTS AND WHY WE COLLECT IT</h3>
<p>Our data processing has various purposes. In principle, we use the data within the scope of customer contact and the fulfilment of the contract, the provision of our offer and the improvement of our online services. Data may also be used for marketing and communication purposes (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b and f GDPR).</p>
<h4>3.1 <a href="https://localistars.com">localistars.com</a> the website and the subdomains</h4>
<p>This website collects and uses personal information for the following reasons:</p>
<p>Like most websites, this site uses Google Analytics (GA) to track user interaction. We use this data to determine the number of people using our site, to better understand how they find and use our web pages and to see their journey through the website.</p>
<p>We consider Google Analytics to be a third party data processor (see section 6 below).</p>
<p>The website is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a>.</p>
<p>We use <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy">Cloudflare</a> as CDN and DNS provider, because of this they may track the website to detect and prevent attacks.</p>
<h4>3.2 Contact forms and email links</h4>
<p>Should you choose to contact us using a contact form on one of our pages or an email link like <a href="mailto:support@localistars.com">this one &quot;support@localistars.com&quot;</a>, none of the data that you supply will be stored by localistars or passed to be processed by any of the third party data processors defined in section 6.0. Instead the data will be collated into an email and sent to us over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol">Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</a> (SMTP). Our SMTP servers are protected by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a> (sometimes known as SSL) meaning that the email content is encrypted using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">SHA-2</a>, 256-bit cryptography before being sent across the internet. The email content is then decrypted by our local computers and devices.</p>
<h4>3.3 <a href="http://localistars.app">localistars.app</a> our online platform service</h4>
<p>Should you choose to signup for our platform service over at <a href="https://www.localistars.app/register">localistars.app</a> your chosen:</p>
<ul>
<li>email address</li>
<li>username</li>
<li>password</li>
</ul>
<p>will be stored in our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito">Amazon Cognito</a> instance. This information is used to identify you as a user.</p>
<p>Your optional profile information, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>firstname</li>
<li>lastname</li>
<li>website</li>
<li>shortbio</li>
<li>language</li>
</ul>
<p>will be stored in our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb">Amazon DynamoDB</a> database and encrypted in 2 different layers.</p>
<p>Your profile will be shown only in private area of the service and is only available to you and other registered users of localistars. This is necessary for the fulfillment of the contract and offering of our service.</p>
<p>If you are under 16 years of age you MUST obtain parental consent before signing up to our service.</p>
<p>Third party data processors used (for details check section 6):</p>
<ul>
<li>reCaptcha</li>
<li>Stripe</li>
<li>Wise</li>
</ul>
<h3>4 HOW WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
<p>As detailed in section 3.3 above, if you signup to our service the personal information as listed above in section 3 will be stored within our database. This is currently the only occasion where personal data will be stored on localistars. This data is stored in an unidentifiable fashion, the storage of this data is done in a pseudonymous fashion meaning that the data would require additional processing using a separately stored ‘key’ before it could be used to identify an individual.</p>
<p>If not stated differently in section 3 and subsections we try to use pseudonymisation for all personal data stored.</p>
<p>We use Amazon Web Services to store all data.</p>
<p>Your personal data will be deleted as soon as it is not anymore necessary for the purposes mentioned in section 3.1.</p>
<h3>5 ABOUT THIS SERVICE’S SERVER</h3>
<p>All traffic (transferral of files) between localistars services and your browser is encrypted and delivered over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS</a>.</p>
<p>If not stated differently in section 3 and subsections our services are hosted by Amazon (AWS), who employ their own security measures. AWS employs industry-recognized certifications and audits:</p>
<ul>
<li>PCI DSS Level 1</li>
<li>ISO 27001</li>
<li>FISMA Moderate</li>
<li>HIPAA</li>
<li>SAS 70 Type II</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of processing data is that Amazon enables us to use Amazon servers. We only store the data for as long as is necessary to achieve this purpose.</p>
<p>localistars and thus your data are hosted in Ireland by Amazon Web Services Inc., 410 Terry Avenue North, Seattle WA 98109, United States. Amazon also adopts stringent technical measures to protect your personal data. Amazon does not pass on your personal data to third parties unless this is necessary in order to perform the agreed services or if Amazon is required to do so by law or to comply with a valid and mandatory instruction issued by a government or regulatory authority. The data provided for this purpose are kept to a minimum.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, Amazon may also store the information in countries outside the European Economic Area. Amazon will, however, take the necessary steps to ensure that an appropriate level of data protection is maintained. If Amazon sends your data to the United States, for example, additional measures are taken, such as concluding EU-compliant data transmission agreements with the data importer if this is necessary. Amazon participates in the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework.</p>
<p>More information from Amazon about data protection is available at: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/eu-data-protection">https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/eu-data-protection</a>.</p>
