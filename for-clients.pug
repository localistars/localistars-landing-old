          h3 Direct Contact

          p.light-font localistars is about you. You're in direct contact with the translator – it's your project, you hold the reins. In contrast to other services we DON'T set the price and therefore we DON'T forward the contract to the cheapest translator to maximize our own profit. You choose the translator for your projects yourself, it's your contractor.
